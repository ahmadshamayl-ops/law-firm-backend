AI-Powered Cash Posting Agent — Proof of Concept


Data Inputs
The AI agent ingests data from multiple sources:

Bank statements (PDF, Excel, CSV, API feeds)

Remittance advices (email attachments, PDF, Excel)

ERP / Accounting system data (open invoices, customer master data, etc.)

Email inbox or SFTP folders (for auto-fetching client payment info)




Preprocessing & Data Extraction
The system uses OCR + NLP to extract structured data:

Identifies payer name, invoice number, payment amount, payment date, and reference number

Handles multiple formats (bank PDFs, Excel, scanned documents)

Standardizes extracted data into a unified structure


Tools:
OCR (Tesseract, Azure Form Recognizer, AWS Textract) NLP / LLM (OpenAI GPT or custom fine-tuned model)


Matching Engine (Core Logic)

The AI agent performs intelligent matching between payments and open invoices using:

Exact matches: Payment reference ? Invoice number

Fuzzy matches: Amount similarity, customer name similarity, date proximity

Multi-invoice matching: One payment covers multiple invoices

Partial matches: Payment covers part of an invoice


The model continuously learns from user corrections to improve matching accuracy over time.


Decision & Posting
After matching:

The agent generates posting entries:

Debit: Bank Account

Credit: Accounts Receivable

If integrated with ERP (SAP, Oracle, QuickBooks, Dynamics, etc.), it can auto-post or
prepare posting files for review.

Exception cases are flagged for human validation via dashboard or email alerts.




Exception Handling
Unmatched or ambiguous payments are routed to a review queue with AI-suggested matches and confidence scores.
Example:

“Couldn’t find invoice for this $2,100 payment — possible match: INV-0087 ($2,098). Confidence: 87%”


Reporting & Continuous Learning
Generates daily or weekly cash posting reports (e.g., match accuracy, automation rate, unapplied cash)

Tracks performance KPIs and continuously improves from user feedback
